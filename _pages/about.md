I am a Ph.D. candidate at BITS Pilani, advised by Prof. Vinay Chamola, working under the ASEAN India Collaborative Project funded by SERB DST. My research focuses on enabling drone-driven smart cities through real-time computer vision, secure communication, and data fusion for drones. I am the Lab In-charge of the IoT Tinker Lab with an 80 lakhs INR funding, mentoring over 20 students on study-oriented and lab-oriented projects. I have co-instructed courses in IoT, Hardware Software Co-design, and Microprocessor Programming and Interfacing.

My expertise lies in designing system architectures for IoT, ML, and Blockchain projects, and I have extensive experience in R&D for robots, drones, and cloud technologies. I have authored multiple papers and led significant projects, showcasing my ability to drive innovation and achieve outstanding results. I am dedicated to applying my technical knowledge and coding skills to create impactful solutions.

My research topics include (but are not limited to):

<ul>
  <li>Real-time computer vision for autonomous drones</li>
  <li>Secure communication protocols for UAVs</li>
  <li>Data fusion techniques for smart city applications</li>
  <li>System architectures for IoT and ML integration</li>
  <li>Blockchain applications in healthcare and mobility</li>
  <li>FPGA-based machine learning model optimization</li>
  <li>Edge computing for IoT devices</li>
  <li>Advanced algorithms for drone navigation and SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)</li>
  <li>Efficient deployment of AI models on embedded systems</li>
  <li>Privacy-preserving technologies for decentralized data marketplaces</li>
</ul>
